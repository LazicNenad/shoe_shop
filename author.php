			<p>Hi, my name is Nenad Lazic and I'm a web developer from Serbia. I've recently started studying IT/Web programming at ICT College because I've always been interested in computers and technology. Although my skills are limited at this moment, I will continuously try to improve them through my studies, projects etc. I'm currently working on my portfolio site.
